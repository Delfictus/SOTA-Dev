//! Phase 2 — Transform Audit Spine.
//!
//! This module introduces the first-class, machine-enforceable vocabulary for
//! PRISM-4D post-MD transforms. It does not define the pipeline's transforms;
//! it defines the **governance surface** they implement.
//!
//! # What this module provides
//!
//! * [`AuditedTransform`] — the canonical trait every governed transform
//!   implements. It carries identity, determinism class, tolerance policy,
//!   a declared law set, a verification hook, and an `apply` entry point
//!   whose return type carries structured audit semantics.
//! * [`DeterminismClass`] — owned by the transform, not the data struct.
//!   Documents whether the transform's output is bit-reproducible, atomics-
//!   affected, or order-dependent under real runtime conditions.
//! * [`TolerancePolicy`] — owned by the transform. Describes how the
//!   transform's output should be compared when a law or a downstream
//!   consumer needs equivalence.
//! * [`TransformViolation`] / [`ViolationEvidence`] / [`AuditRouting`] —
//!   structured, machine-readable law failures. No string-only errors.
//! * [`AuditOutcome`] — typed three-way outcome: `Accepted`, `Quarantined`
//!   (output accepted but carries site-local violations), or `Aborted`
//!   (structural/corruption-class failure — no output produced).
//! * [`AuditRecord`] — lightweight lineage carried with every outcome so
//!   downstream consumers can trace which transform produced an output and
//!   under what governance.
//!
//! # What this module explicitly does NOT provide (Phase 2 non-goals)
//!
//! * No rank-monotonicity / order-theoretic (Family B) laws. Those belong
//!   to Phase 9 population-level governance, not to local transform spine.
//! * No tolerance calibration envelopes. Empirical calibration is Phase 8.
//! * No serialization format for outcomes or violations. JSON/Arrow export
//!   is a downstream concern to be handled when a consumer requires it.
//! * No general graph-runtime machinery. The spine wires one transform at
//!   a time; the DAG shape is implicit in the call graph, not in the
//!   framework.
//!
//! # Scope hook
//!
//! The first transform wrapped under this spine is
//! [`clustering_to_clustered_sites::ClusteringToClusteredSites`], which
//! governs the canonical site-construction boundary and enforces two
//! Family-A local algebraic laws (`GvmPopulated`, `EmissionCompatMatchesGvm`).
//! See that module for the concrete wrapping pattern.

// The concrete first-wrap transform depends on `build_clustered_sites`,
// which is itself feature-gated on `gpu`. Match that gate here so the
// framework types in this file remain feature-agnostic while the
// concrete wrap is only compiled where its dependencies exist.
#[cfg(feature = "gpu")]

/// Phase 3 second wrap: `ClusterToCausome` consumes the
/// `ClusteredBindingSite` output of Phase 2 + KCC per-site data and
/// emits typed `CausomeBlock` (Pillar 2) under
