//! # Interferometric Adjudicator — the F1 SWITCH brain
//!
//! Implements the **Brain** of the PRISM-4D Digital Spatiotemporal
//! Interferometer (per the Claude-2 Architectural Mandate, Blackwell
//! Convergence Project). The Adjudicator computes the Kullback-Leibler
//! divergence Δ_AB between the Relaxed (P) and UV-Perturbed (Q) SO(3)
//! power spectra produced by Claude-1's WMMA tensor-core kernels
//! ([`crate::so3_project`]), thresholds the result against a running
//! 3-sigma thermal noise floor, and writes a 32-bit `adjudication_code`
//! into pinned device memory. The Blackwell `sm_120` hardware
//! scheduler reads that code and routes the F1 `cudaGraphConditionalNode`
//! to one of three sub-graphs:
//!
//! | code | route                             | trigger                                       |
//! |------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
//! | `0`  | Prune Noise                       | Δ_AB ≤ μ_noise + 3σ                            |
//! | `1`  | Burst Detected — heavy bisimulation| Δ_AB > μ_noise + 3σ                            |
//! | `2`  | Hard Trap — invariant violation   | NaN / Inf / non-positive ratio in log argument|
//!
//! The Adjudicator is a **Total Function**: every 32-bit bit-pattern
//! at the kernel input maps to exactly one valid `adjudication_code`
//! ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Inline PTX guards (see [`Self::APPLY_GUARD_DOC`])
//! prevent any `NaN` from leaving the kernel.
//!
//! ## Memory layout — 256-byte zero-trust lock (Emergency Rectification 2026-05-02)
//!
//! Per CSR-section C of the mandate, `sizeof::<InterferometricAdjudicatorFfi>()`
//! is **256 bytes exactly** (two Blackwell L1 sectors).  The operator's
//! Emergency Kill / Zero-Trust Alignment directive reverts `gear_override`
//! to its B.3.2 home at offset 100 and renames two fields for ABI clarity
//! (`force_prune_mask` → `force_prune_mask_ptr`; `d_potential_energy` →
//! `potential_energy`).  `d_external_work` retains its M1.2.18.5 pointer-
//! fusion semantics (`*mut f64` at offset 128) so multi-kernel asynchronous
//! atomicAdd-f64 contributions (UV kicks, ASC, force/velocity clamps) land
//! in a single F2-pool address — no read-modify-write hazard.

//!
//! ## M1.2.17 — Layout pivot (operator unified directive 2026-05-02)
//!
//! `d_velocities` removed from the struct (was at offset 120 in B.3.2).
//! It remains a `PipelineConfig` field — the gearbox SWITCH bodies'
//! velocity-rescale kernel reads it through populator FFI plumbing,
//! not through the FFI struct.
//!
//! `d_potential_energy` is the system-wide potential energy SCALAR
//! VALUE (not a pointer) at offset 112.  The CUB DeviceReduce::Sum
//! captured node writes it every step from the per-atom AMBER PE
//! components buffer.  The SFA kernel reads it for the 1% drift
//! Hamiltonian Stability Fuse → Gear 3 trap on instability.
//!
//! `d_dt` moves to offset 120; T12 Pre-Flight pre-capture
//! `cuMemcpyHtoD` wire-up updated.
//!
//! ## `gear_override` Hardware Interlock (operator Zero-Trust 2026-05-02)
//!
//! `gear_override` is the **Manual Override Invariant** — a u32 at
//! offset **100** that the host (operator or safety script) writes via
//! `cuMemcpyHtoDAsync` to force a gear shift independent of the
//! KL-driven adjudication state machine.  Sentinel `0xFF` = Auto
//! (gearbox is free to choose); values 0..3 = manual force to that
//! gear.  The predicate-bridge kernel reads this field on every
//! captured-graph launch and short-circuits the SFA's calculated gear
//! when override is set.
//!
//! Slot history: B.3.2 placed `gear_override` at offset 100 (claiming
//! the implicit padding for `force_prune_mask_ptr`'s 8-byte alignment).
//! M1.2.18.5 attempted to move it to offset 136 to free that slot for
//! `_pad_100`; the Emergency Rectification reverted it to offset 100
//! per the operator's Forced-Gear Supervisor Shim spec which writes to
//! `(adj_dev + 100)` directly.
//!
//! ## T12 Pre-Flight — connective tissue (Wave A)
//!
//! `d_dt` and `d_velocities` are wired in for Wave B's G26 chronometric
//! gearbox: the SWITCH body sub-graphs will swap the integrator's dt
//! coefficient and rescale velocities on gear-transition frames.
//! Wave A leaves these pointers wired but UNCONSUMED — no kernel
//! reads them, no integrator depends on them. Pure surface prep.
//!
//! ## Anti-Greenfield § 6.2 — `legacy_centroid_fallback`
//!
//! Stores a single `[f32; 3]` representative centroid that legacy
//! `nhs_rt_full.rs` site-logging can read without understanding the
//! full SO(3) manifold. Populated by the Adjudicator kernel from
//! `relaxed_manifold_ptr->aabb` mid-point at every step. This lets
//! the legacy diagnostic-script path observe site coordinates
//! through the same ABI it always used; new code reads the full
//! manifold via the typed pointers above. **Surgical extension, not
//! parallel type.**
//!
//! ## Anti-Greenfield § 5 — adjudication-code reuse
//!
//! The `adjudication_code` field stores values from the existing
//! [`crate::pre_rank::AdjudicationCode`] enum (RECT-2, commit
//! `0993bf9b`). T0 originally defined parallel `ADJUDICATION_PRUNE /
//! _BURST / _ABORT` constants on this type — those have been removed
//! per the Anti-Greenfield Scavenge-Before-Code rule. Decode raw u32
//! values via [`crate::pre_rank::AdjudicationCode::from_raw`].
//!
//! The compile-time `const _: () = { assert!(...) }` block at the foot
//! of this file enforces the invariant; the runtime test module
//! pins every field's byte-offset.
//!
//! ## F2 pool allocation requirement
//!
//! Per the F2 mandate, `InterferometricAdjudicatorFfi` instances MUST
//! be allocated via [`crate::vram_pool::VramPool::alloc_async`]
//! (`cudaMallocFromPoolAsync`) and remain pointer-stable for the
//! entire MD campaign. `cudaMalloc` and static `__device__` arrays
//! are **forbidden** — the former host-syncs (breaking captured-graph
//! replay), the latter limits multi-stream scalability and would
//! exceed the 164 KB shared-memory limit on `sm_120`.
//!
//! ## F1 race-condition prevention (CSR-D)
//!
//! Within the Adjudicator kernel, the writes to `current_divergence`
//! and `adjudication_code` happen on the same single thread in
//! program order. A `__threadfence()` immediately before the
//! `adjudication_code` store flushes the divergence write to L2
//! before the SWITCH-node read can observe a stale value. The kernel
//! launches as `<<<1, 1, 0, stream>>>` so the only ordering question
//! is between the kernel's exit and the SWITCH-node's next read,
//! which the captured-graph topology already serialises (the SWITCH
//! node is downstream of the Adjudicator node in the same stream).
//!
//! ## Wavelength encoding — open question for T1
//!
//! The mandate's T1 spec calls for ingesting `wavelength_nm` from
//! [`crate::rich_spike::RichSpike`]. The CLA-1 schema as committed
//! at `40c4db10` does **not** include a `wavelength_nm` field. Two
//! resolution paths are tractable without an FFI break:
//!
//!   1. Pack the 4 authorised wavelengths into the
//!      `RichSpike::spike_source` enum (currently `LIF / UV / EFP /
//!      LADD / COFIRE`) by adding `UV_260`, `UV_280`, `UV_305`,
//!      `UV_320` discriminants.
//!   2. Pack the wavelength index (2 bits) into the high bits of
//!      `RichSpike::intensity_packed`.
//!
//! T1 is blocked on operator decision. Option (1) is preferred —
//! the wavelength is a property of the perturbation source, and
//! the source enum is the natural carrier.

// Wave 0 / Task #68 — KL-DIVERGENCE NOISE-FLOOR BOOTSTRAP
// ============================================================================
//
// The Adjudicator step kernel's threshold formula is
//   threshold = adj->noise_floor_mu[0] + 3.0f * adj->noise_floor_sigma[0]
// and the test it gates is `fabsf(total_kl) > threshold` (Wave 0 fix
// 2026-05-02, prior code compared signed `total_kl` against the same
// threshold and silently dropped half the divergence half-plane).
//
// `total_kl` is the 4-plane WEIGHTED KL DIVERGENCE
// `Σ_planes ω_p · Σ_l p_l · log2(p_l/q_l)`.  It is dimensionless and
// — under cold-hold (relaxed≈perturbed manifolds) — should sit at
// magnitudes ≪ 1.  Warm-phase divergence events run several orders
// of magnitude larger (the legacy CPU PCMI/SURP loop sees Σ KL
// bursts in the 10² range on 7C8R).
//
// `T7_CALIBRATED_MU` / `T7_CALIBRATED_SIGMA` (above) are the
// **C_l power-spectrum** statistics from cold-hold sampling.  Plugging
// those into `adj->noise_floor_mu[0..6]` (μ[0]≈0.805) gave a threshold
// of ~1.249 — comparing apples to oranges.  The 15k 7C8R campaign
// (2026-05-02) exposed this: 35k steps, 0 GhostTileFrame records.
//
// The KL bootstrap below seeds `adj->noise_floor_mu[0]` and
// `adj->noise_floor_sigma[0]` with KL-magnitude priors small enough
// that the very first warm-phase divergence event lifts above the
// threshold, while Dynamic T7 (`dynamic_t7.cu`) takes over at
// `PRISM_DYNT7_N_MIN = 100` samples and replaces the bootstrap with
// the substrate's measured cold-hold KL μ/σ via stream-ordered
// `atomicMin`/`atomicMax`-free in-place writes.
//
// Why these specific numbers
//   μ_kl_boot      = 0.0    (cold-hold KL is centred near zero in
//                            both directions — the relaxed and
//                            perturbed manifolds are statistically
//                            identical in equilibrium).
