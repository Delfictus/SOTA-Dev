//! Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (Adams & MacKay, 2007).
//!
//! Stage 1B-2: principled, parameter-light replacement for the magic
//! `chunk_size = 500` constant in the autonomous chunk loop. The fixed
//! 500-step chunking is wall-clock-driven; this module provides the
//! foundation for **physics-driven** chunking where chunk boundaries are
//! placed at points the model identifies as regime changes (changepoints)
//! in the per-stream spike rate stream.
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! BOCPD maintains, at each timestep `t`, a posterior distribution over
//! the **run length** `r_t` — the number of steps since the most recent
//! changepoint. The posterior is updated recursively at each new
//! observation `x_{t+1}`:
//!
//!   • **Growth**:
//!     P(r_{t+1} = r + 1 | x_{1:t+1}) ∝ (1 − H(r)) · π(x_{t+1} | r)
//!                                      · P(r_t = r | x_{1:t})
//!   • **Reset** (a changepoint just occurred):
//!     P(r_{t+1} = 0 | x_{1:t+1}) ∝ Σ_r H(r) · π(x_{t+1} | r)
//!                                  · P(r_t = r | x_{1:t})
//!   • **Normalize** so the run-length posterior sums to 1.
//!
//! Where:
//!   • `H(r)` is the **hazard function** — the prior probability of a
//!     changepoint given the current run length. For a constant-hazard
//!     process H is independent of `r` and equals `1/expected_run_length`.
//!     For PRISM-TWIN we parameterize H by the CCNS protocol phase so
//!     cold_hold has long expected runs (low hazard) and warm_hold has
//!     short expected runs (high hazard).
//!   • `π(x | r)` is the **predictive distribution** of the next
//!     observation given a run of length r. For PRISM spike-rate
//!     observations we use a Gaussian with running mean and variance
//!     (Welford's online algorithm) per run length.
//!
//! The output of interest is `P(r_t = 0 | x_{1:t})` — the posterior
//! probability that the most recent observation was a changepoint. When
//! this exceeds a threshold (default 0.5 = "more likely than not"), the
//! caller can interpret it as "regime change detected, close the chunk."
//!

//! detection.* arXiv:0710.3742.

//! on-line changepoint detection with model selection.* For the
//! multi-stream extension where N parallel streams share a common
//! protocol-phase hazard.
//!
//! ## Why this is non-naive
//!
//!   1. **Zero magic constants in the run-length update.** The hazard
//!      function takes its expected run lengths from the actual CCNS
//!      protocol step counts (`cold_hold_steps`, `ramp_steps`,
//!      `warm_hold_steps`). The threshold for "close the chunk" is the
//!      single user-facing tunable, expressible as P(reset) > τ or
//!      equivalently as a log-odds ratio in bits.
//!   2. **Numerically stable**. All updates are in log space using
//!      `log_sum_exp` to avoid underflow on long observation streams.
//!   3. **Bounded memory**. The run-length posterior is pruned to
//!      `MAX_RUN_LENGTH` entries; older run lengths get folded into
//!      a tail bucket so the posterior never grows unbounded.
//!   4. **Online**. O(MAX_RUN_LENGTH) per observation. No retraining,
//!      no batch refit, no parameter tuning.
//!   5. **The same machinery feeds Stage 1B-3 GC-PID** — the per-chunk
//!      BOCPD posterior is the natural conditioning variable for the
//!      Gaussian-copula PID synergy estimator.

/// Maximum run length to track in the posterior. Beyond this, the
/// posterior is truncated and the tail mass is collapsed to the
/// truncation boundary. 256 is a generous upper bound for chunk-rate
/// observations: at one observation per 500 MD steps and a 55 000-step
/// run, we get 110 observations total — well under 256.
pub const MAX_RUN_LENGTH: usize = 256;

/// Default posterior threshold for chunk close decisions. When
/// `P(r_t = 0 | x_{1:t}) > BOCPD_CLOSE_THRESHOLD`, the caller should
/// treat the most recent observation as a changepoint and close the
/// current chunk.
///
/// 0.5 means "more likely than not a changepoint occurred" — the
/// canonical Bayesian decision threshold. In bits this is a log-odds
/// ratio of 0 (zero evidence either way; the threshold sits exactly at

/// detection should pass a higher value (0.8 ≈ 2 bits = "4× more likely
