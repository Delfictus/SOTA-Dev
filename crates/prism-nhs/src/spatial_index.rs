//! Spatial Neighbor Index — backend-agnostic neighbor-finding contract
//!
//! Phase 1 of the LBVH lane (2026-04-21 canonical lockdown).
//!
//! This trait is the single API boundary between Layer 1 (spatial indexing)
//! and Layer 2 (clustering / persistence analysis). Any backend — OptiX RT,
//! CUDA LBVH, or grid-LIGSITE debug — implements this trait and is drop-in
//! compatible with `hierarchical_clustering.rs`.
//!
//! **Production rule #10 (2026-04-21):**
//!   - LBVH is the default on SM120+.
//!   - Grid-LIGSITE is debug-only behind `--clustering-backend=grid`.
//!   - `--clustering-backend=grid` combined with `--multi-differential`
//!     is a hard ERROR in production (see nhs_rt_full.rs dispatch).
//!
//! Source of truth: `crates/prism-nhs/src/bin/nhs_rt_full.rs` dispatch region.
