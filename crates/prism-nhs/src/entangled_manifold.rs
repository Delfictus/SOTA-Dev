//! Entangled Transform — typed manifold views with strict AABBs.
//!
//! This module is the type-definition layer for the architecture
//! described in `docs/PRISM4D_ENTANGLED_TRANSFORM_BLUEPRINT.md`. It
//! satisfies blueprint mandates **M4** (strict struct typing for
//! 2+2+2+2 graph prep) and **M5** (LBVH-ready, support-only AABBs).
//! It does NOT yet implement the producer (`SpikeToCluster4D`,
//! mandate M1) or any CUDA / FFI code — those land in subsequent
//! commits, layered on top of these types.
//!
//! # Relationship to existing modules
//!
//! * [`crate::spatial_view::CentroidManifold`] — the *legacy* per-site
//!   container that holds **point** centroids per [`crate::spatial_view::SpatialView`].
//!   It is M5-non-conformant by design (point-centroids are
//!   insufficient for LBVH). We retain it for downstream readers that
//!   were migrated in Phase 1; new code SHOULD use [`EntangledManifold`].
//! * [`crate::causome::CausomeBlock`] — the per-site Pillar-2 typed
//!   block (driver residue id + KCC sub-scores). [`CausalDriverView`]
//!   here is the *spatial* counterpart to that scalar block: same
//!   driver semantics, lifted to a deterministically-ordered support
//!   set with an AABB.
//!
//! # What is in this commit (and what is not)
//!
//! Present:
//!
//! * [`Aabb`] — POD, `repr(C)`, support-only constructor.
//! * [`CausalSignal`] — typed enumeration of authoritative selection
//!   signals (M3).
//! * [`SelectionPolicy`], [`TieBreakerPolicy`], [`ViewProvenance`] —
//!   provenance carried on every view (M3 + M6 audit).
//! * [`CausalDriverView`], [`LiningContactView`], [`LocalizedSubclusterView`] —
//!   typed views (M4) with SoA-layout support sets (M4 1:1 tensor
//!   channel mapping).
//! * [`EntangledManifold`] — top-level container of the three role
//!   views for a single MD frame.
//!
//! Deliberately absent (later commits):
//!
//! * Producer logic (`SpikeToCluster4D`, M1) — selection from spike
//!   tensors and KCC tensors lives in a separate commit.
//! * CUDA kernels and FFI shims — same.
//! * Any conversion to / from the legacy [`crate::spatial_view::CentroidManifold`].
//!   That bridge belongs to the producer, not the type module.
//!
//! # Memory layout notes (M4)
//!
//! Each view stores its support set in **structure-of-arrays** form:
//! `support: Vec<i32>`, `causal_values: Vec<f32>`. The two vectors
//! are parallel (same length, same indexing). When the GPU producer
//! lands, each `Vec` maps directly to one device-side tensor channel
//! via a single `cudaMemcpy` — no host-side repack. AoS would force
//! a transpose at upload; we avoid it by construction.
//!
//! [`Aabb`] is `#[repr(C)]` so its layout is FFI-stable and matches
//! the Morton-encoder kernel's expected input. The view structs
//! themselves are not `repr(C)` because they own [`Vec`]s, whose
//! layout (pointer + len + capacity) is not stable across compilers
//! and is irrelevant for tensor mapping — what gets uploaded is the
//! `Vec`'s data pointer, which is well-defined.

// At M1, only `SpikeAttributionCount` carries honest values across the

// initialized to `f64::NAN` by the M1 producer; they become honest as
// M2 / M3 land. The progressive-population semantics
// (see [`CausalSortKey`]) walk the priority list and select the first
// field where ALL residues in the support set have non-NaN values, so
// the NaN sentinel doubles as the activation gate for higher-priority
// sort fields. No code change is required to "turn on" causal sorting
