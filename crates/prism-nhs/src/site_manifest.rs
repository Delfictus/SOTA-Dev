//! M1.1 — Per-site canonical container types.
//!
//! This module defines the **per-site** Rust types referenced in the
//! M1 execution contract (B1 §4 binding spec) and the M1 readiness
//! report. It is the type-definitions layer of the M1 lane; FFI
//! declarations, `AuditedTransform` impls, and constructors that take
//! [`crate::entangled_manifold::CausalSortKey`] land in M1.2 / M1.3.
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! Three distinct types at three distinct layers in the M1
//! architecture:
//!
//! * [`crate::entangled_manifold::EntangledManifold`] — *frame-level*,
//!   M5-conformant, 3 typed role-views (`CausalDriverView`,
//!   `LiningContactView`, `LocalizedSubclusterView`) with LBVH-ready
//!   AABBs. Produced on-device by the M1.2 clustering kernel.
//! * [`SiteManifest`] — *per-site* canonical Rust type. One instance
//!   per detected site. Holds the 8-slot [`CentroidManifold`]
//!   projection plus per-site identity, causal scalars, frame index,
//!   an opaque [`EntangledManifoldId`] reference back to the
//!   frame-level manifold, and the [`CausalSortKey`] used to order
//!   the constituent role-view residues
//!   (`source_manifold_id` and `sort_lineage` together provide the
//!   audit trail back to the producer).
//! * [`CentroidManifold`] — *per-site, 8-slot* projection of the
//!   frame-level role views, named-accessor-only, M5-non-conformant
//!   (point centroids, not AABBs) by design. This is the canonical
//!   per-site centroid container; the legacy
//!   [`crate::spatial_view::CentroidManifold`] (3-slot, point centroids,
//!   `Option<[f32; 3]>` shape) is deprecated as of M1.1 with migration
//!   of the two `persistent_engine.rs` callsites scheduled for the
//!   POST-M1 steering wiring lane.
//!
//! # M1 vs later lanes — what is honest at M1
//!
//! At M1, only the producer's geometric / attribution outputs are
//! honest:
//!
//! * `CentroidManifold::geometric()`, `lining()`, `driver()` are
//!   populated from the corresponding frame-level role-view AABBs
//!   (each AABB contributes its center via `Aabb::center()`).
//! * Phase-dependent slots — `hot_phase`, `cold_phase`, `burst_motion`,
//!   `validation_structural`, `ligand_adjacent_subcluster` — are
//!   `Option::None` at M1. M2 / M3 populate them as their producers
//!   land.
//! * [`CausalScalars::spike_attribution_count`] is honest at M1.
//!   The four floating-point causal fields (`kcc_score`,
//!   `transfer_entropy`, `causal_dg`, `causal_lag`) are initialized
//!   to `f64::NAN`. M2 fills `kcc_score`; M3 fills the rest.
//!
//! No code change is required to "turn on" M2 / M3 fields — the data
//! becoming honest (NaN → finite) is the activation mechanism. This
//! aligns with the role-aware composite causal sort's
//! progressive-population semantics
//! (see [`crate::entangled_manifold::CausalSortKey`]).
//!
//! # Frame-index sentinels
//!
//! [`Centroid3D::frame`] is `u64`. The reserved sentinel value
//! `u64::MAX` means "frame not yet set" (rare; only legitimately
//! used during construction before the frame is known). Frame `0`
//! is a real frame and MUST NOT be used as a placeholder.
