//! Autonomous ASC Rescue Controller (Tier-2).
//!
//! Data-driven, continuous-magnitude rescue decisions for the ASC
//! (Adaptive Steering Controller) when the neuromorphic engine falls into
//! a zero-spike (or critically low spike) regime. Every rescue action
//! magnitude is derived from information-theoretic observables — no
//! hardcoded step sizes, no magic multipliers.
//!
//! ## Design principle
//!
//! The ASC already fires on physics events (new residue onset, bursts,
//! interferometric matches, phase transitions) and emits steering focus
//! residues ranked by GC-PID synergy_fraction. The rescue controller is an
//! EXTENSION of that decision layer: when the observed information content
//! (spike rate, cross-group phase coherence, synergy) drops below a
//! target-dependent floor for a regime-stable window, it augments the
//! existing focus list with rescue-weighted entries whose magnitudes are
//! derived from the observed deficit.
//!
//! Because the existing `write_steering_focus` path already mutates
//! ProtocolState at runtime via host-side `cuMemcpyHtoDAsync`, no new
//! device APIs are required for the v1 rescue controller. Rescue actions
//! are expressed as modifications to the `current_steering_focus` list
//! that the ASC publishes each chunk.
//!
//! Two rescue actions are out of reach for v1 (they require engine kernel
//! changes to make the corresponding ProtocolState fields host-mutable):
//!   * REST2 lambda per-stream perturbation
//!   * NMA amplification multiplier
//! These are emitted as `RescueAction::EngineV2Required(...)` variants for
//! telemetry but are NOT applied by the v1 controller; they serve as a
//! forward-compatible disclosure of the rescue primitives the controller
//! CAN reason about, gated on pending engine kernel work.
//!
//! ## References used
//!
//! * Ince 2017 Gaussian-copula PID — `crate::gcpid::PidAtoms::synergy_fraction`
//!   provides the synergy signal the rescue controller monitors per residue.
//! * Adams & MacKay 2007 BOCPD — `crate::bocpd::BocpdState::recent_changepoint_probability`
//!   provides the regime-stability gate; rescue is suppressed during
//!   detected changepoints.
//! * Otsu 1979 — the engine's per-channel spike filtering already uses
//!   Otsu's method; the rescue controller accepts the engine's current
//!   Otsu threshold as part of the observation window and sizes UV-boost
//!   rescue magnitudes to close the distance between observed and
//!   target percentile of the intensity distribution.
//! * Williams & Beer 2010 — PID decomposition, for the synergy-vs-
//!   redundancy distinction (synergy_fraction drives rescue focus).
//!
//! ## Entry points
//!
//! Callers construct an [`ObservationWindow`] from the chunk-local ASC
//! shared state, build [`RescueTargets`] once per run from the target's
//! expected information profile (protein size, aromatic density, etc.),
//! and invoke [`RescueController::decide`] each chunk. The returned
//! `Vec<RescueAction>` is applied by mutating `current_steering_focus`
//! before the Stage-2 steering writeback fires.
