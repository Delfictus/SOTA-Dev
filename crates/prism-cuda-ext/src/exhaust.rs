//! Zero-Copy Spike Data Exhaust Pipeline
//!
//! Streams spike data from GPU to system RAM via PCIe DMA without
//! interrupting the CUDA graph or involving the CPU in the data path.
//!
//! Architecture:
//!   GPU compact kernel → mapped pinned host memory (PCIe DMA) → Rust harvester thread → NVMe
//!
//! The mapped memory appears as a device pointer to the GPU, but the
//! physical memory lives in system DDR5 RAM. GPU writes go through
//! the PCIe Gen 5 DMA engine (32 GB/s) asynchronously — no SM ALU
//! cycles, no CUDA graph interruption, no stream synchronization.
//!
//! Data format: RingSpikeEvent (48 bytes per spike) with fields:
//!   timestep, voxel_idx, x, y, z, intensity, vibrational_energy,
//!   water_density, n_nearby_excited, spike_source, wavelength_nm
//!
//! The spike_source field tags each spike's origin channel:
//!   0 = LIF, 1 = UV, 2 = RAF, 3 = EFP, 4 = LADD, 5 = COFIRE
//!
//! This channel tagging is what enables the 109-model ensemble
//! teacher to learn channel-specific dynamics for distillation
//! into the zero-shot student model.
