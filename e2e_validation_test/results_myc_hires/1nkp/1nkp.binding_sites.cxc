# ========== Color Legend ==========
# Magenta = Catalytic residues (GLU, ASP, HIS, SER, CYS, LYS)
# Forest Green = Aromatic residues (PHE, TYR, TRP)
# Gold = Hydrophobic residues (ALA, VAL, LEU, ILE, MET, PRO)
# Slate surface = Pocket cavity
# Red marker = Druggable site centroid
# Gray marker = Non-druggable site centroid

# ========== Usage ==========
# To view pocket: view pocket1_lining
# To hide surface: hide pocket1_lining surface
# To show H-bonds: hbonds pocket1_lining
